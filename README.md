# Erodium_Biomimetic_Simulation
3D Simulation of an Erodium-Seed-Inspired Tumor Penetration Actuator (Three.js).
# Erodium Seedâ€“Inspired Drug Delivery Simulation

This project is an **interactive 3D simulation** inspired by the drilling mechanism of the Erodium seed.  
It visualizes how a hygroscopic twisting actuator with barbed microstructures could penetrate tumor-like tissue and release drugs in a targeted way.

## Features
- 3D visualization using **Three.js**, **JavaScript**, and **HTML**.
- Demonstrates **twisting/anchoring actuator mechanics**.
- Simulated **drug release** inside a soft tumor model.
- Inspired by challenges in **cancer nanomedicine**.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Interact with the 3D model (rotate, zoom, etc.).
